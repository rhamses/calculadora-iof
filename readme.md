# About the project. # 

"Calculadora IOF" it is a simple project that calculates exchange rates of a given foreign currency to Brazilian Real (BRL) according to the quota of the day taking in consideration the IOF tax that occurs over such a transation, giving as a result the real cost of an international purchase. 

## Why did you create this? ##
I repeatedly did this type of calculation and often had underrated the cost because I've always forgot the taxes over the purchase, so I decided to create something that would help me on this matter. And also, was a good opportunity to learn new things.

## What are the goals of this project? ##
I'm working on this as a lab project for everything that it's new to the development world that can fit inside the scope. Started really messy, with UI and API mixed together, and over time I was able to decoupled the API, refactored the UI with a new design and a little less code, and now I'm focus on refactoring the Javascript portion with everything ES6 has to offer and more. 

## What's on the roadmap? ##
- [ ] There's a lot things that I'm thinking to put on the project. The IOF tax it's an universal tax in Brazil that occurs in every single money transaction, and I covered just one facade of it until now. 
- [ ] Also, There are a couple of correlate taxes that could be useful right now (such as deliverying costs, and customs tax) but it's not implemented yet. 
- [x] A sharing feature (that could be better, but works for now).
